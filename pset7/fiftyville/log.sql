-- Raymond|As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who 
-- talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say 
-- that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville 
-- tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to 
-- purchase the flight ticket.
-- TODO: Check for phone calls with a duration of less than a minute at around
